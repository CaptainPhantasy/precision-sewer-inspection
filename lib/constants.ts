export const CONVERSATIONAL_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'Should I get a sewer scope on an older home in Indianapolis?',
    answer: "Yes—especially in Central Indiana, where many older homes still have clay tile or cast iron lines that deteriorate over decades. A $159 scope shows you the exact condition before you're responsible for it.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does a sewer scope inspection take?',
    answer: 'Most inspections take 30-60 minutes on-site. Your HD video and written report arrive within one business day, with same-day delivery available if you are on a deadline.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a sewer camera inspection show?',
    answer: 'The camera shows the inside of your sewer line in HD: roots, cracks, bellies, offsets, corrosion, and blockages, with footage-counter readings so you know exactly where each issue sits. You see the same video we do—no interpretations you cannot verify.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does a sewer scope inspection cost in Indiana?',
    answer: 'Our standard inspection is $159 with cleanout access, including HD video and a written report within one business day. Alternate access methods cost a bit more (roof vent +$50, toilet pull +$65, crawl space +$30), and we confirm all pricing before work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How to tell if a sewer line has tree roots?',
    answer: 'Recurring slow drains, gurgling, and backups that return after clearing are the usual signs—especially in yards with mature trees. Only a camera shows roots for certain: they appear as fibrous masses intruding at the joints of the line.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does a standard home inspection cover the sewer line?',
    answer: "No—general home inspectors do not scope sewer lines; the underground lateral is outside their standard scope. That is exactly why a dedicated sewer scope matters: it is the one major system a standard inspection never sees.",
  },
]

export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: 'How much does a sewer scope cost in Indiana?',
    answer: 'Our standard sewer scope inspection is $159 with cleanout access, which includes HD video recording and a written report delivered within one business day. Additional fees may apply for alternative access methods: +$50 for roof vent access, +$65 for toilet pull (includes new wax ring and supply line), +$30 for crawl space access. We believe in transparent, upfront pricing—no hidden fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if access requires a toilet pull?',
    answer: "Toilet pull access is $65 additional. This includes removing and reinstalling the toilet with a brand new wax ring and supply line. We always replace the supply line because reusing old supply lines is the number one cause of post-inspection leaks. We'll confirm the access method and pricing before beginning work.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if no one is home or access isn't available?",
    answer: 'A $79 trip fee may be charged on a case-by-case basis. This typically applies when access to the sewer system is unavailable, incorrect information was provided about the property, or no one is home at the scheduled time. To avoid this fee, please ensure someone is available and verify access to the clean-out before your appointment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about multiple cleanouts on a property?',
    answer: 'If additional cleanouts need to be inspected on the same visit, the first cleanout is $159 and each additional cleanout is $129. This allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of larger or more complex sewer systems at a reduced rate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer bulk pricing for investors or brokerages?',
    answer: 'Yes! We offer prepaid volume packages designed for real estate professionals and investors. Our 10-scope bundles and 25-scope brokerage packages include per-scope discounts and priority scheduling. Contact us for custom volume pricing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do volume packages work?',
    answer: 'Volume packages are prepaid bundles purchased upfront at a discounted per-scope rate. You receive priority scheduling and dedicated support. Packages can be used across multiple properties. The more you purchase, the greater your savings.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does an inspection take?',
    answer: "Most inspections are completed in 30-60 minutes on-site. You'll receive your video and premium written report within one business day, or same-day for an additional fee if you're under a tight deadline.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What equipment do you use?',
    answer: "We run three professional camera scope systems, matched to the job. Our high-end system carries an electronic locator and sonde transmitter — that lets us pinpoint the camera's exact underground location and depth from the surface. Every system records high-definition video for your report.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer hydro jetting?',
    answer: 'Yes — as preparation for a proper inspection. Roots, grease, and scale can stop the camera before it reaches the real problem, so when a line needs it, we jet it first. That way your scope covers the whole pipe, not just the first few feet. Jetting is priced with your inspection.',
