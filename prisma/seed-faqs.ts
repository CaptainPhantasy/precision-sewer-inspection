  {
    question: 'What is a sewer camera inspection?',
    answer: 'A sewer camera inspection involves inserting a specialized waterproof camera into your sewer line to visually inspect the entire pipe. Our high-resolution cameras can travel through bends and transitions, identifying cracks, root intrusion, blockages, bellies, offset joints, and other issues. The entire process is recorded, and you receive a complete video report along with a written summary of findings.',
    shortAnswer: 'A sewer camera inspection uses a waterproof video camera to inspect your pipes and identify problems like cracks, roots, and blockages.',

  {
    question: 'How long does a sewer inspection take?',
    answer: 'A standard sewer inspection typically takes 30-60 minutes depending on the complexity of your system and the length of the sewer line. Simple inspections on average homes take about 45 minutes. If additional access points need to be located or if significant issues are found, the inspection may take longer.',

  {
    question: 'Do I need to be home during the inspection?',
    answer: 'For the initial portion of the inspection, we recommend you be present so we can explain what we find in real-time. However, if you need to leave, we can complete the inspection and provide you with a complete video and written report afterward. If accessing an exterior cleanout, we typically do not need anyone home after initial access is confirmed.',

Every system records high-definition video for your report.',

  // TECHNICAL
  {
    question: 'What can a sewer camera find that other methods cannot?',
    answer: 'Sewer camera inspections can identify many issues that aren\'t detectable through external inspection or drain cleaning: Hairline cracks in pipes, Root intrusion (even small amounts), Offset or separated joints, Bellies (low spots where waste collects), Grease buildup, Foreign objects, Pipe material deterioration, and collapsed or crushed sections. This information helps you address problems before they become emergencies.',

  {
    question: 'How do I know if I need a sewer inspection?',
    answer: 'Consider an inspection if: You\'re buying or selling a home, You\'re experiencing slow drains or recurring clogs, You smell sewer gas in your home, You have multiple drains backing up simultaneously, You\'re planning major renovations, You notice wet spots in your yard near sewer lines, Your home is over 25 years old and hasn\'t had an inspection, or You\'re just being proactive about home maintenance.',
    shortAnswer: 'Get an inspection when buying/selling, with slow drains, bad smells, or as preventive maintenance.',

    sortOrder: 2,
    isPublished: true
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between sewer inspection and drain cleaning?',
    answer: 'Sewer inspection uses a camera to see inside pipes and diagnose problems. Drain cleaning uses specialized tools to remove clogs and buildup. Think of it this way: inspection diagnoses, cleaning treats. Often we\'ll inspect first to see exactly what\'s causing problems, then recommend cleaning only if needed. This approach saves you money by avoiding unnecessary cleaning.',
    shortAnswer: 'Inspection diagnoses problems with a camera; cleaning removes blockages. We inspect before recommending cleaning.',

Our cameras work in pipes from 2 to 12 inches in diameter.',

  },
  {
    question: 'What is a sewer belly and why does it matter?',
    answer: 'A "belly" is a low spot or sag in the sewer line where waste and water collect instead of flowing freely. Bellies can cause slow drains, frequent clogs, and waste accumulation that leads to pipe deterioration. They\'re often caused by soil settling or improper original installation. Our camera can identify bellies and measure their depth, helping you decide if repair is needed.',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can you inspect pipes under a concrete slab?',
    answer: 'Yes, if there\'s an accessible entry point (like a cleanout or toilet drain), we can often inspect pipes running under concrete slabs. However, some slab pipes may require cutting access holes or using existing plumbing connections. We\'ll assess your specific situation and explain all options during booking.',
    shortAnswer: 'Yes, through accessible entry points. We\'ll assess your situation and explain all options.',

  // PROCESS
  {
    question: 'What happens during a sewer inspection?',
    answer: 'Here\'s what to expect: 1) Technician arrives and accesses your sewer system, usually through an exterior cleanout. 2) Camera is inserted and travels through the entire accessible sewer line. 3) You can watch the live video feed if you\'d like. 4) Technician identifies and explains issues as they\'re found. 5) Camera is removed and final assessment is provided. 6) Written report and video recording are prepared and delivered. The whole process typically takes 45-60 minutes.',

  {
    question: 'How do I prepare for my inspection?',
    answer: 'Preparing for your inspection is simple: Clear access to your cleanout (usually in the yard or basement), Ensure toilets are accessible for potential toilet removal access, Make a list of any drain problems you\'ve noticed, Have your home\'s plumbing history ready if available, and Plan to be home for at least the beginning of the appointment. No need to stop using your drains beforehand—our camera can work through normal waste.',
    shortAnswer: 'Clear cleanout access, make a list of drain issues, and be present at the start. Normal drain use is fine.',

    isPublished: true
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a cleanout and do I need one?',
    answer: 'A cleanout is a covered access point that allows entry into your sewer line. If your home doesn\'t have an accessible cleanout, we may need to create one during the inspection or recommend installation. Some inspections can be performed through a toilet drain, but cleanout access is preferred as it provides a better view of the entire system. We can discuss your specific situation when you book.',
    shortAnswer: 'A cleanout is an access point to your sewer line. We can often work through toilets if no cleanout exists.',
